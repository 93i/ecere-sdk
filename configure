echo "The Ecere cross-platform SDK is pre-configured. Just type:

		mingw32-make; if you're on Microsoft® Windows™
				(You need MinGW: http://www.mingw.org/)

		make;   if you're on Apple® Mac™ OS X™
				(Leopard™/Xcode™ recommended)

or simply	make;  if you are on GNU/Linux™


The SDK can probably be built on BSD and other Unixes with some additional
jiggery-pokery."
