echo "The Ecere cross-platform SDK is pre-configured. Just type:

		mingw32-make; if you're on Microsoft® Windows™
				(You need MinGW: http://www.mingw.org/)

      If you're on Apple® Mac™ OS X™, first add your toolchain bin directory
      to the path and set SYSROOT to the SDK directory. e.g. with Xcode 4.5.2:

		export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin
      export SYSROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.7.sdk
      make;
				(Lion™/Xcode 4.5.2™ recommended)


or simply	make;  if you are on GNU/Linux™


The SDK can probably be built on BSD and other Unixes with some additional
jiggery-pokery."
