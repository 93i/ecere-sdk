The Ecere SDK v0.44 - http://ecere.com

The Ecere SDK is a cross-platform toolkit for building software applications.
It currently runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X (through X11).
With the Ecere SDK, you can develop applications once and deploy them on all 
supported platforms alongside a lightweight runtime environment.
It introduces eC, an object oriented language derived from and fully compatible
with C, compromising neither runtime performance nor ease of use.
A built-in 3D engine supporting both Direct3D and OpenGL is fully integrated.

 * INSTALLATION *

Please refer to the latest instructions at http://ecere.com/wiki/

To build from source, simply type make.

It should build fine on Linux, on Windows with MinGW,
and on Mac OS X with a bit of luck.

To install, type make install.

Please note that at this time eC and the Ecere SDK only support 32 bit.
However, you should still be able to use the 32 bit version on a 64 bit machine.
64-bit support is planned for the future.

 * DOCUMENTATION *

The Ecere Tao of Programming is a Programmer's Guide (still work in progress)
that will teach you the foundations of eC and Ecere. You will find it under:

On Windows:    %PROGRAMFILES%\Ecere SDK\doc\Ecere Tao of Programming [work in progress].pdf
On Linux/Unix: /usr/share/doc/tao.pdf

Please refer the samples that come with the SDK:

On Windows they get installed in %APPDATA%\Ecere SDK\Samples
On Linux/Unix they get installed in /usr/share/ecere/samples/
You can also find the latest versions on GitHub:

http://github.com/ecere/sdk/tree/master/samples

The Documentor is a tool under development to browse and document the APIs of
eC modules. You can use it to browse all available classes, methods and properties
of the Ecere runtime library.
However, at the moment the tool itself is being improved, and so not much 
descriptive info has been added yet.
